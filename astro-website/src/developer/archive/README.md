# Documentation Archive

This directory preserves historical and obsolete documentation for reference.

## Purpose

Archive deprecated features, superseded specifications, and historical analysis that may still provide valuable context but is no longer actively maintained.

## Categories

- **Deprecated Features**: Features that have been removed or replaced
- **Superseded Specifications**: Specifications replaced by newer versions
- **Historical Analysis**: Technical analysis from previous implementations
- **Migration Records**: Documentation of major migrations and refactors

## Active Documentation

For current documentation, see:

- [User Documentation](../user/)
- [Developer Documentation](../developer/)
- [Active Specifications](../specifications/)

## Archive Policy

Documentation is moved to archive when:

1. Feature is deprecated or removed
2. Specification is superseded by a newer version
3. Analysis is historical and no longer applicable to current implementation
4. Content provides historical value but is not actively maintained

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-18
