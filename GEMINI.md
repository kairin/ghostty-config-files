# Ghostty Configuration Repository for Gemini

This repository contains a simplified and consolidated configuration for Ghostty, the GPU-accelerated terminal emulator. The goal is to provide a clean, compliant, and highly usable Ghostty setup, with a focus on:

- **Compliance:** Adhering to the official Ghostty configuration documentation (`https://ghostty.org/docs/config`).
- **Simplicity:** Consolidating multiple configuration files into a single `config` file, reducing complexity and redundancy.
- **Usability:** Enhancing the user experience with features like:
    - **Clear Scrollback:** Ensuring a large scrollback buffer and a clearly visible scrollbar for easy navigation of terminal output.
    - **Optimized Keybindings:** Integrating productivity-focused keybindings for efficient workflow.
    - **Consistent Theming:** Applying a unified theme for a visually appealing and comfortable environment.

This setup aims to make Ghostty more accessible and powerful for daily use, providing a robust and streamlined terminal experience.
