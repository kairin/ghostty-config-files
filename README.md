This repository contains a comprehensive terminal environment setup featuring the Ghostty terminal emulator with performance optimizations, right-click context menu integration, and integrated AI tools.

## Features

- **Ghostty Terminal**: Pre-configured for performance and aesthetics.
- **ZSH + Oh My ZSH**: A powerful shell with useful plugins.
- **Modern Unix Tools**: `eza`, `bat`, `ripgrep`, `fzf`, `zoxide`, and `fd`.
- **AI Integration**: Claude Code and Gemini CLI are integrated into the terminal.
- **Context Menu**: "Open in Ghostty" right-click option in your file manager.
- **Astro-Based Website**: A documentation and dashboard website built with Astro.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 25.04 or a compatible Linux distribution.
- Git installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ghostty-config-files.git
    cd ghostty-config-files
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script:**
    ```bash
    ./start.sh
    ```

This script will install all necessary dependencies, configure your terminal, and set up the Astro website.

### Using manage.sh

The repository includes a unified management interface:

```bash
# Install complete environment
./manage.sh install

# Update all components
./manage.sh update

# Validate system
./manage.sh validate

# Build documentation
./manage.sh docs build

# Start documentation dev server
./manage.sh docs dev

# Get help
./manage.sh --help
./manage.sh <command> --help
```

For detailed usage, see [docs-source/user-guide/usage.md](docs-source/user-guide/usage.md).

### Running the Website

After the installation is complete, you can run the website locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server, and you can view the website at `http://localhost:4321/ghostty-config-files/`.
