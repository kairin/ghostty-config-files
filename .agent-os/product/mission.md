# Ghostty Configuration Mission

This repository aims to provide an optimized, compliant, and user-friendly Ghostty terminal configuration. Our goals are:

-   **Compliance:** Adhere to official Ghostty documentation.
-   **Modularity:** Maintain a modular and organized configuration structure.
-   **Usability:** Enhance with clear scrollback, optimized keybindings, and consistent theming. The provided scripts are robust and ensure a smooth update experience.

This repository serves as a reference for a powerful Ghostty experience.
