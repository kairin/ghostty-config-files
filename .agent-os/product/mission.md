# Ghostty Configuration Mission

This repository aims to provide an optimized, compliant, and user-friendly Ghostty terminal configuration. Our goals are:

-   **Compliance:** Adhere to official Ghostty documentation.
-   **Modularity:** Maintain a modular and organized configuration structure.
-   **Usability:** Enhance with clear scrollback, optimized keybindings, and consistent theming. The provided scripts (located in `scripts/`) are robust and ensure a smooth update experience with comprehensive configuration protection.
-   **Sudo Behavior**: The script should run normally, and the `sudo` password prompt should only appear after dependency checks, and only if `apt install` or other privileged operations are required.
-   **No New Scripts:** Do not create new scripts to fix issues. Resolve problems within existing scripts.
-   **To-Do List Confirmation:** Every task from now on must generate a to-do list that requires user confirmation before checking off anything from the to-do list.
-   **Present To-Do List:** At every step, present the current to-do list to the user.

This repository serves as a reference for a powerful Ghostty experience.
