# Current Ghostty Configuration Specification

## Active: Consolidated and Compliant Ghostty Configuration

### Status
- [x] Consolidated all modular Ghostty configuration files into a single `config` file.
- [x] Ensured the `config` file adheres to the official Ghostty documentation (https://ghostty.org/docs/config).
- [x] Implemented clear scrollback with a visible scrollbar by setting `scrollback-limit`, `scrollbar`, and `scrollbar-auto-hide`.
- [x] Integrated productivity-focused keybindings directly into the `config`.
- [x] Applied a consistent and aesthetic theme within the `config`.
- [x] Updated `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` to reflect the new repository goals.
- [x] Rephrased `.agent-os/README.md`, `product/mission.md`, and `product/architecture.md` to align with the Ghostty configuration repository's purpose.

### Next Steps
1.  **Review and Refine `config`:** Continuously review the consolidated `config` file for further optimizations, adherence to best practices, and new Ghostty features.
2.  **Automate Validation:** Develop or identify scripts to validate the `config` file against Ghostty's expected format and ensure all settings are correctly applied.
3.  **User Feedback Integration:** Establish a process for incorporating user feedback to further enhance usability and address common pain points.
4.  **Explore Advanced Features:** Investigate and integrate advanced Ghostty features (e.g., custom shaders, advanced font rendering) as appropriate, ensuring they align with the repository's mission.
