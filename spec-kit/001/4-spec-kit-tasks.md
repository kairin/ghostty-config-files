# 1. MANDATORY: Local CI/CD validation
./local-infra/runners/gh-workflow-local.sh all || exit 1

# 2. Only proceed if validation passes
git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
git add .
git commit -m "Complete Task X: Description

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME"
git checkout main
git merge "$BRANCH_NAME" --no-ff
git push origin main
# PRESERVE BRANCH: Never delete without explicit permission
