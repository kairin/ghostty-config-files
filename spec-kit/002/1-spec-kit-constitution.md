# 1. Constitution - Production Deployment & Maintenance Excellence

**Feature**: 002-production-deployment
**Phase**: Constitution
**Prerequisites**: Feature 001 (Modern Web Development Stack) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Constitutional Mission Statement

**We establish the immutable principles for Feature 002: Production Deployment & Maintenance Excellence**, building upon the successful completion of Feature 001 while addressing critical production gaps and establishing production-ready infrastructure with constitutional compliance.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Principles for Production Excellence

### I. Zero GitHub Actions Production Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**All production workflows SHALL execute locally first, with zero GitHub Actions consumption for routine operations**

- **Production Deployment**: GitHub CLI automation with local CI/CD validation
- **Monitoring Setup**: Local monitoring configuration before external service integration
- **Maintenance Workflows**: All maintenance automation executes locally with GitHub CLI integration
- **Emergency Response**: Local emergency resolution procedures with zero Actions dependency
- **Validation**: Continuous GitHub Actions usage monitoring with constitutional alerts

### II. Production-First Performance Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Production infrastructure SHALL exceed Feature 001 constitutional targets while maintaining reliability**

- **Deployment Performance**: <5 minute automated deployments with <30 second rollback
- **Production Targets**: Lighthouse 95+, <100KB JS, <2.5s LCP maintained in production
- **Uptime Requirements**: 99.9% availability SLA with <1 hour MTTR
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time constitutional compliance tracking in production
- **Optimization Mandate**: Production performance SHALL exceed constitutional targets by 20%

### III. Production User Preservation Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Production changes SHALL preserve user experience with zero data loss and instant recovery**

- **Atomic Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployments with instant rollback capability
- **Configuration Preservation**: All user customizations preserved during production updates
- **Backup Mandate**: Automated backup before every production change with <1 hour RTO
- **Recovery Procedures**: Instant rollback capability with complete user experience restoration
- **Impact Assessment**: User impact assessment required for all production changes

### IV. Production Branch Preservation Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**Production branches SHALL follow constitutional naming with complete deployment history**

- **Production Naming**: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-prod-[description] for all production branches
- **Deployment History**: Complete audit trail of all production deployments preserved
- **Rollback Branches**: Rollback capability through preserved deployment branches
- **No Deletion**: Production branches NEVER deleted without explicit approval
- **History Integrity**: Complete git history maintained for all production operations

### V. Production Local Validation Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
**All production changes SHALL be validated locally before deployment with constitutional compliance**

- **Local Testing**: Complete production simulation locally before deployment
- **Constitutional Validation**: All five principles validated before production deployment
- **Quality Gates**: Production deployment blocked if local validation fails
- **Performance Validation**: Constitutional targets validated locally before production
- **Emergency Procedures**: Even emergency fixes require local constitutional validation

## üìä Constitutional Compliance Framework

### Zero GitHub Actions Validation
```bash
# Continuous GitHub Actions usage monitoring
gh api user/settings/billing/actions | jq '.total_minutes_used'
# MUST remain at 0 for Feature 002 operations

# Production deployment validation
./local-infra/runners/production-deployment.sh --validate-actions-usage
```

### Production Performance Validation
```bash
# Constitutional performance targets in production
curl -s "https://kairin.github.io/ghostty-config-files/" | \
./local-infra/runners/performance-monitor.sh --validate-production

# Expected results: Lighthouse 95+, <100KB JS, <2.5s LCP
```

### User Preservation Validation
```bash
# Backup validation before production changes
./local-infra/runners/production-backup.sh --verify
# Expected: Complete backup with <1 hour RTO capability

# Rollback capability validation
./local-infra/runners/production-rollback.sh --test
# Expected: <30 second rollback time
```

### Branch Preservation Validation
```bash
# Production branch naming validation
git branch --remote | grep -E "[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{6}-prod-"
# Expected: All production branches follow constitutional naming

# Deployment history validation
./local-infra/runners/deployment-history.sh --validate
# Expected: Complete audit trail of all deployments
```

### Local Validation Framework
```bash
# Complete local validation before production
./local-infra/runners/pre-production-validation.sh --full
# Expected: All five constitutional principles validated locally
```
