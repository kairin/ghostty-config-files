## 🏛️ Constitutional Compliance Framework

### Five Core Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

#### I. Zero GitHub Actions Production Principle
**All production workflows SHALL execute locally first, with zero GitHub Actions consumption for routine operations**
- Production deployment via GitHub CLI automation with local CI/CD validation
- Continuous GitHub Actions usage monitoring with constitutional alerts
- Local emergency resolution procedures with zero Actions dependency

#### II. Production-First Performance Principle
**Production infrastructure SHALL exceed Feature 001 constitutional targets while maintaining reliability**
- Deployment performance: <5 minute automated deployments with <30 second rollback
- Production targets: Lighthouse 95+, <100KB JS, <2.5s LCP maintained in production
- Optimization mandate: Production performance exceeds constitutional targets by 20%

#### III. Production User Preservation Principle
**Production changes SHALL preserve user experience with zero data loss and instant recovery**
- Atomic deployments with zero-downtime and instant rollback capability
- Automated backup before every production change with <1 hour RTO
- Complete user experience restoration through rollback procedures

#### IV. Production Branch Preservation Principle
**Production branches SHALL follow constitutional naming with complete deployment history**
- Production naming: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-prod-[description] for all production branches
- Complete audit trail of all production deployments preserved
- Production branches NEVER deleted without explicit approval

#### V. Production Local Validation Principle
**All production changes SHALL be validated locally before deployment with constitutional compliance**
- Complete production simulation locally before deployment
- All five principles validated before production deployment
- Even emergency fixes require local constitutional validation
