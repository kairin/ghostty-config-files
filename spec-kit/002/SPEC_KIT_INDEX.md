## üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Principles (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### I. Zero GitHub Actions Production Principle
All production workflows SHALL execute locally first, with zero GitHub Actions consumption for routine operations.

### II. Production-First Performance Principle
Production infrastructure SHALL exceed Feature 001 constitutional targets while maintaining reliability.

### III. Production User Preservation Principle
Production changes SHALL preserve user experience with zero data loss and instant recovery.

### IV. Production Branch Preservation Principle
Production branches SHALL follow constitutional naming with complete deployment history.

### V. Production Local Validation Principle
All production changes SHALL be validated locally before deployment with constitutional compliance.

## üö® Critical Implementation Notes

### Constitutional Compliance (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- All implementations MUST maintain zero GitHub Actions consumption
- Production performance MUST exceed constitutional targets
- User experience MUST be preserved during all changes
- All production branches MUST be preserved with complete history
- Local validation MUST occur before all production changes

### Emergency Procedures
- Emergency production setup available via `./local-infra/runners/emergency-production.sh`
- Rollback capability <30 seconds via `./local-infra/runners/deployment/rollback.sh`
- Incident response automation via `./local-infra/runners/incident-response.sh`

### Quality Assurance
- Pre-deployment validation required for all changes
- Constitutional compliance validation before all deployments
- Performance regression prevention with automated gates
- Accessibility and security validation in all pipelines

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Implementation Support
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation guide in [5-spec-kit-implement.md](5-spec-kit-implement.md)
- **Scripts**: All implementation scripts in `local-infra/runners/`
- **Validation**: Constitutional compliance validation via `./local-infra/runners/constitutional-validation.sh`
- **Monitoring**: Production status dashboard via `./local-infra/runners/production-status.sh`

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Use gradual migration strategy in [5-spec-kit-implement.md](5-spec-kit-implement.md)
2. **Deployment Failures**: Check local CI/CD validation and constitutional compliance
3. **Monitoring Issues**: Verify service configuration and webhook integration
4. **Performance Regression**: Use rollback procedures and performance validation gates
