# Specification Quality Checklist: Repository Structure Refactoring

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

### Content Quality Assessment
- ✅ Specification avoids implementation details (no specific shell syntax, module file paths are requirements not implementation)
- ✅ Focus on user/developer value (improved productivity, clarity, maintainability)
- ✅ Understandable by non-technical stakeholders (business value clear)
- ✅ All sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear
- ✅ All requirements testable (can verify manage.sh commands work, docs separate, modules independent)
- ✅ Success criteria measurable (time reductions, task completion, no regressions)
- ✅ Success criteria technology-agnostic (e.g., "find source files on first attempt" not "grep docs directory")
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios defined for each user story (5 scenarios per story)
- ✅ Edge cases identified (invalid commands, partial migrations, circular dependencies)
- ✅ Scope bounded (three clear user stories with priorities)
- ✅ Assumptions documented (docs directory handling, incremental migration, minimal customizations)

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- ✅ FR-001 through FR-015 map to acceptance scenarios and success criteria
- ✅ Three user stories cover all primary flows (unified interface, clear docs, modular scripts)
- ✅ Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 directly measurable
- ✅ No implementation leakage (requirements describe "what" not "how")

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase. No additional clarifications needed.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization (P1: immediate value, P2: prevents issues, P3: long-term maintainability)
- Independent testability for each user story
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Strong backward compatibility requirements
- Measurable success criteria

**Recommendation**: Proceed to planning phase
