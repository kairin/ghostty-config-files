1. **CRITICAL CONFLICT**: Spec §FR-011 requires splitting AGENTS.md into docs-source/ but constitutional requirement mandates CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md remain symlinks to AGENTS.md
2. **CRITICAL FINDING**: CLAUDE.md is currently a REGULAR FILE (26k), not a symlink to AGENTS.md (as verified by `ls -la`)
3. **CRITICAL GAP**: No validation automation specified for symlink integrity or branch naming compliance

---

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate (Critical Priority)

1. **Resolve CLAUDE.md Symlink Issue**:
   ```bash
   # CRITICAL: CLAUDE.md is currently a regular file, not a symlink
   cd /home/kkk/Apps/ghostty-config-files
   mv CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup  # Preserve current content
   ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md       # Create proper symlink
   git add CLAUDE.md
   git commit -m "fix: Convert CLAUDE.md to symlink to AGENTS.md per constitutional requirement"
   ```

2. **Resolve Spec Conflict (CHK126-CHK130)**:
   - Clarify whether AGENTS.md will be split OR symlinks preserved (cannot be both)
   - Update Spec §FR-011 to explicitly state: "Split AGENTS.md content into docs-source/ for Astro site, BUT AGENTS.md file itself remains as single source, with CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md as symlinks"

3. **Create Validation Automation**:
   - Implement pre-commit hook validating symlinks (CHK042-CHK046)
   - Implement pre-push validation for branch naming (CHK056, CHK071)
   - Add to local CI/CD workflow (CHK029-CHK035)

### High Priority (Complete Before Implementation)

4. **Document Branch Naming Examples** (CHK014, CHK041):
   - Add examples covering all scenarios: features, fixes, docs, refactors, chores
   - Specify description format rules (kebab-case, max 50 chars, no special chars)

5. **Define Recovery Procedures** (CHK076-CHK080):
   - Document how to recreate broken symlinks
   - Document how to recover accidentally deleted branches
   - Document how to fix incorrect branch names

6. **Clarify Exception Handling** (CHK070-CHK075):
   - Define what happens when local CI/CD fails (block commit or warn?)
   - Define response to symlink converted to regular file (auto-fix or alert?)
   - Define handling of merge conflicts during --no-ff merge

### Medium Priority (Enhance Quality)

7. **Add Measurable Acceptance Criteria** (CHK056-CHK061):
   - Define specific exit codes for each validation failure
   - Define automated test criteria for symlink integrity
   - Define automated test criteria for branch name compliance

8. **Document Edge Cases** (CHK081-CHK095):
   - Handle symlinks across filesystems
   - Handle datetime conflicts from multiple developers
   - Clarify rebasing policy (prohibited or allowed?)

9. **Add Non-Functional Requirements** (CHK096-CHK110):
   - Performance targets for validation scripts (<5s)
   - Usability requirements for error messages
   - Logging and audit trail requirements

## Validation Against Original Request

**User Requirements Met**:
- ✅ "Make it clear and critical that CLAUDE.md remain as symlinks" → CHK001-CHK007, CHK042-CHK046, CHK070, CHK126-CHK130
- ✅ "Branch and feature naming strategy" → CHK008-CHK014, CHK036-CHK041, CHK086-CHK090
- ✅ "Use the same naming schema of date-time naming structure currently available" → CHK008, CHK036-CHK038
- ✅ "When commit and pushing to remote repo" → CHK015-CHK028, CHK062-CHK065

**Scope Coverage**:
- ✅ Q1: B - CLAUDE.md + GEMINI.md + any other agent symlinks → CHK001-CHK007, CHK052-CHK055
- ✅ Q2: C - Format requirements + validation + examples + automation → CHK008-CHK014, CHK036-CHK041, CHK056-CHK058, CHK096-CHK100
- ✅ Q3: C - Full constitutional compliance for git operations → CHK015-CHK035, CHK047-CHK051, CHK062-CHK095, CHK101-CHK140

**Critical Findings for User**:
1. **🚨 CLAUDE.md is NOT a symlink** - Currently a 26k regular file (see ls -la output above)
2. **⚠️ Spec conflict** - FR-011 says split AGENTS.md but constitution says keep it + symlinks
3. **⚠️ No validation automation** - Branch naming and symlink integrity not validated in hooks/CI

This checklist provides comprehensive "unit tests for requirements" validating that all constitutional git operation and agent symlink requirements are properly specified, clear, consistent, and enforceable.
