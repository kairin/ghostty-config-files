4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → ✅ COMPLETE: No violations found, all requirements align with constitution
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Updated Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check PASS
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → ✅ COMPLETE: All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved via spec-kit guide integration
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Generated all Phase 1 artifacts (data-model.md, local-cicd-runner.yaml, quickstart.md, AGENTS.md updates)
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → ✅ COMPLETE: No new violations after design phase
   → ✅ COMPLETE: Updated Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check PASS

```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 9. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Primary requirement: Establish a modern web development stack integrating uv for Python dependency management (≥0.4.0), Astro.build for static site generation (≥4.0), Tailwind CSS (≥3.4) + shadcn/ui for component-driven UI, and GitHub Pages deployment with mandatory local CI/CD infrastructure ensuring zero GitHub Actions consumption and 95+ Lighthouse scores.

Technical approach: Constitution-compliant implementation leveraging existing spec-kit guidance with comprehensive local CI/CD infrastructure including build simulation, performance monitoring, and branch preservation strategy.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (via uv), TypeScript strict mode, Node.js 18+ (LTS)
**Primary Dependencies**: uv (≥0.4.0), Astro.build (≥4.0), Tailwind CSS (≥3.4), shadcn/ui (latest), GitHub CLI
**Storage**: Static files, configuration files (pyproject.toml, astro.config.mjs, tailwind.config.mjs)
**Testing**: Local CI/CD simulation, Lighthouse audits, accessibility testing, contract validation
**Target Platform**: GitHub Pages (static hosting), Local development environment (Linux/macOS/Windows)
**Project Type**: web - frontend with Python automation scripts
**Performance Goals**: Lighthouse scores 95+, First Contentful Paint <1.5s, JavaScript bundles <100KB
**Constraints**: Zero GitHub Actions consumption, local CI/CD mandatory, branch preservation required
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer or small team, modern web projects, zero-cost deployment pipeline

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **I. uv-First Python Management**: Compliant - Exclusive use of uv (≥0.4.0) for all Python operations
✅ **II. Static Site Generation Excellence**: Compliant - Astro.build (≥4.0) with TypeScript strict mode, performance targets specified
✅ **III. Local CI/CD First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: Compliant - Mandatory local workflow simulation, zero GitHub Actions consumption
✅ **IV. Component-Driven UI Architecture**: Compliant - shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS, accessibility requirements
✅ **V. Zero-Cost Deployment Excellence**: Compliant - GitHub Pages with branch preservation strategy

**Result**: PASS - All constitutional principles satisfied, no violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Web application with frontend focus and Python automation support

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - All technology choices clearly specified in spec-kit guide
   - No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers remain
   - Dependencies well-documented in constitutional requirements

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - uv Python management best practices ✅ (from spec-kit guide)
   - Astro.build static site generation patterns ✅ (from spec-kit guide)
   - Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui integration ✅ (from spec-kit guide)
   - Local CI/CD infrastructure setup ✅ (from spec-kit guide)
   - GitHub Pages deployment strategy ✅ (from spec-kit guide)

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Technology stack from constitutional requirements
   - Rationale: Performance, cost-effectiveness, developer experience
   - Alternatives considered: Traditional CI/CD vs local-first approach

**Output**: research.md with all decisions documented and justified

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Project Configuration entity (uv, Astro, Tailwind, shadcn/ui settings)
   - Local CI/CD Infrastructure entity (runners, logs, configuration)
   - Development Workflow entity (git hooks, branch strategy, validation)
   - Performance Metrics entity (Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals)
   - Deployment Pipeline entity (GitHub Pages, asset optimization)

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Local CI/CD runner interfaces (astro-build-local.sh, gh-workflow-local.sh)
   - Performance monitoring contracts (performance-monitor.sh)
   - Configuration validation contracts (pre-commit-local.sh)
   - Output contracts to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Local build simulation validation tests
   - Performance threshold verification tests
   - Configuration validation tests
   - Tests must fail initially (TDD approach)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Fresh environment setup validation
   - Local CI/CD workflow execution
   - GitHub Pages deployment verification
   - Component system integration testing

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Update existing AGENTS.md with spec-kit integration details
   - Preserve constitutional requirements and local CI/CD mandates
   - Add modern web development stack guidance

**Output**: ✅ data-model.md, ✅ /contracts/local-cicd-runner.yaml, ✅ quickstart.md, ✅ AGENTS.md updates

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base with local CI/CD task categories
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each local CI/CD runner → setup and validation task [P]
- Each configuration entity → creation and validation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks following constitutional order

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Local CI/CD infrastructure first, then tests, then implementation
- Constitutional compliance order: uv environment, Astro setup, Tailwind+shadcn/ui, deployment
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent configuration files)
- Local validation gates between each major phase

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on local CI/CD setup, constitutional compliance, and zero-cost deployment

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations detected. All requirements align with established principles:
- uv-first Python management maintained
- Local CI/CD infrastructure properly planned
- Zero-cost deployment strategy preserved
- Performance and accessibility standards upheld

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
