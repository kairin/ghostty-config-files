## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer setting up a modern web project, I need a comprehensive development stack that provides Python automation capabilities, fast static site generation, modern UI components, and cost-effective deployment with local development validation, so that I can build performant websites without ongoing hosting costs while maintaining code quality through local CI/CD validation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh development environment, **When** I initialize the modern web stack, **Then** I get a fully configured project with uv Python environment, Astro.build framework, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components, and local CI/CD infrastructure ready for development

2. **Given** I make changes to my project, **When** I commit code, **Then** all validations (build, performance, security) run locally first before any GitHub operations, ensuring zero GitHub Actions consumption for routine development

3. **Given** a completed project, **When** I deploy to GitHub Pages, **Then** the site loads with 95+ Lighthouse scores, sub-1.5s load times, and full accessibility compliance

4. **Given** I need to add new features, **When** I use the component system, **Then** I have access to accessible, themeable UI components that work seamlessly with the styling system

### Edge Cases
- What happens when local CI/CD validation fails? (Commit should be blocked with clear error messages)
- How does the system handle dependency updates? (Automated detection with local validation before deployment)
- What if GitHub Actions are accidentally triggered? (Monitoring alerts and usage tracking)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide Python dependency management exclusively through uv (>=0.4.0) with no alternative package managers allowed
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate static sites using Astro.build (>=4.0) with TypeScript strict mode enforced
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide UI components through shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS (>=3.4) integration and full accessibility compliance
- **FR-004**: System MUST deploy to GitHub Pages with zero ongoing hosting costs
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute all CI/CD workflows locally before any GitHub operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST achieve Lighthouse scores of 95+ across all metrics (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain JavaScript bundle sizes under 100KB for initial load
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide local build simulation that mirrors exact GitHub Actions environment
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement performance monitoring with automated tracking of Core Web Vitals
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce branch preservation strategy with timestamped naming convention
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide hot module replacement for all file types during development
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate code quality through integrated linting, formatting, and type checking
- **FR-013**: System MUST support dark mode with class-based strategy and consistent design tokens
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement security scanning for both Python and Node.js dependencies
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide comprehensive logging and error handling for all local CI/CD operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Configuration**: Contains uv Python environment settings, Astro build configuration, Tailwind design system, and shadcn/ui component definitions
- **Local CI/CD Infrastructure**: Includes runner scripts for build simulation, performance monitoring, deployment validation, and error logging
- **Development Workflow**: Encompasses git hooks, branch strategy, commit validation, and local-first CI/CD execution
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks Lighthouse scores, Core Web Vitals, bundle sizes, and build times with historical comparison
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Manages GitHub Pages configuration, asset optimization, HTTPS enforcement, and zero-cost compliance monitoring
