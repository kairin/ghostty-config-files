# Specification Quality Checklist: Task Archive and Consolidation System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks passed

**Details**:
- Content focuses on capabilities and outcomes without implementation details
- User stories are prioritized (P1, P2, P3) with clear value propositions
- Requirements are specific and testable (FR-001 through FR-015)
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentage, completion rates)
- Edge cases cover validation, partial completion, dependencies, and organization
- Assumptions section clearly documents constraints and expectations
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`

## Notes

- Specification leverages existing work context (YAML archives already created for 004, 005, 001, 002)
- Requirements align with demonstrated needs from recent repository analysis
- Success criteria are realistic and derived from existing implementation patterns
