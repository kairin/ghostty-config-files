PRIMARY_PROVIDER="claude"      # Default for complex reasoning
SECONDARY_PROVIDER="openai"    # Fallback for code generation
TERTIARY_PROVIDER="gemini"     # Final fallback for basic tasks

2. Route complex queries to Claude, code queries to OpenAI
3. Implement exponential backoff for rate limit handling
4. Cache responses to reduce API calls by 70%
```

**API Key Management Best Practices:**
- **Environment Variables**: Store in `.env` files with `.gitignore` protection
- **Key Rotation**: Automated monthly key rotation with zero-downtime switching
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track API usage to prevent unexpected charges
- **Local Fallbacks**: Offline command database for network unavailability

### 2.3 Context-Aware AI Integration

**Context Sources for Enhanced AI Responses:**
```bash
# System Context Collection
- Current directory and Git repository state
- Recently executed commands (last 10)
- Current shell environment variables
- Active tmux/screen sessions
- Running processes and system load
- Current branch and uncommitted changes

# Privacy-Preserving Context Filtering
- Exclude sensitive environment variables (API keys, passwords)
- Hash file paths containing personal information
- Remove proprietary project names and internal URLs
- Sanitize command history for personal data
```

## 3. Performance Optimization Techniques

### 3.1 Shell Startup Performance Analysis

**Startup Time Bottlenecks (2025 Research):**
```bash
# Common Performance Issues and Solutions
Bottleneck                 | Impact    | Solution
---------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------
Plugin Loading             | 60-120ms  | Lazy loading with demand-based activation
Completion Generation      | 40-80ms   | Async generation with caching
Theme Rendering            | 20-60ms   | Instant prompts with background updates
Environment Setup          | 30-50ms   | Parallel initialization
Git Status Checking        | 10-30ms   | Background refresh with cached display
```

**Lazy Loading Implementation Strategies:**
```bash
# Oh My Zsh Lazy Loading Pattern
- Load essential functions immediately (<20ms)
- Defer plugin initialization until first use
- Cache completion data between sessions
- Background refresh of expensive operations
- Progressive loading based on usage patterns
```

### 3.2 Intelligent Caching Systems

**Multi-Level Caching Architecture:**
```bash
# Level 1: Memory Cache (Session-based)
- Command completions in RAM (1MB typical)
- Recent command results cache (5MB limit)
- Git status cache with 5-second TTL

# Level 2: Disk Cache (Persistent)
- Compiled zsh functions (~/.zsh_cache/)
- Pre-computed completions database
- AI response cache with 7-day expiration

# Level 3: Shared Cache (Team-based)
- Team-specific completion databases
- Shared AI response cache (anonymized)
- Common command pattern optimizations
```

**Cache Invalidation Strategies:**
- **Time-based**: Automatic expiration for dynamic content
- **Content-based**: Hash-based validation for static resources
- **Event-based**: Directory changes, Git operations trigger cache refresh
- **Manual**: User-initiated cache clearing for troubleshooting

### 3.3 Compilation and Preprocessing

**Zsh Function Compilation:**
```bash
# Automatic .zcompdump optimization
- Recompile when plugins change
- Background compilation during idle time
- Compressed completion database (zstd compression)
- Parallel compilation for multi-core systems
```

**Theme Preprocessing:**
```bash
# Powerlevel10k Instant Prompt Technology
- Pre-render prompt segments in background
- Cache expensive operations (Git status, Node version)
- Display cached prompt immediately (<5ms)
- Update with fresh data asynchronously
```
