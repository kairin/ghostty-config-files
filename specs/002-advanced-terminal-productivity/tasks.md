# Tasks: Advanced Terminal Productivity Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/kkk/Apps/ghostty-config-files/specs/002-advanced-terminal-productivity/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Implementation plan found with tech stack and constitutional compliance
   → Extract: Shell/ZSH, Python 3.12+, AI providers (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google), chezmoi
2. Load optional design documents:
   → spec.md: Extract AI integration, theming, performance, team collaboration requirements
   → No contracts/ (terminal enhancement, not API-based)
   → No data-model.md (configuration-based, not entity-driven)
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Foundation Validation: Existing setup preservation tests
   → AI Integration: Multi-provider setup, privacy protection, local fallbacks
   → Advanced Theming: Powerlevel10k/Starship with performance optimization
   → Performance: Intelligent caching, lazy loading, <50ms startup
   → Team Collaboration: chezmoi integration, template system
   → Constitutional Compliance: Continuous validation throughout
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different configuration files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file/system = sequential (no [P])
   → Foundation validation before any advanced features
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph based on constitutional phases
7. Create parallel execution examples for independent components
8. Validate task completeness ✅
```
