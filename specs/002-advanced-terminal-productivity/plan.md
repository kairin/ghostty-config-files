**Structure Decision**: Terminal enhancement system with modular components extending existing foundation with comprehensive installation tracking and uv-first Python management

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks Identified
1. **AI Provider Integration**: Research zsh-codex multi-provider configuration for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
2. **Advanced Theming**: Compare Powerlevel10k vs Starship performance characteristics and constitutional compliance
3. **Performance Optimization**: Research ZSH startup profiling and intelligent caching strategies
4. **Team Collaboration**: Evaluate chezmoi vs alternatives for secure dotfile management
5. **Constitutional Integration**: Validate advanced features alignment with terminal excellence principles

### Research Execution
Using Task tool for comprehensive research to resolve all technical unknowns and establish implementation foundations.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

### Entity Extraction for data-model.md
- **AI Integration System**: Multi-provider configuration, context awareness, privacy controls
- **Theme Management**: Adaptive theming, performance monitoring, environment detection
- **Performance Monitor**: Startup profiling, cache management, lazy loading system
- **Installation Registry**: Tool tracking, version management, update strategies, dependency resolution
- **Python Environment**: uv-first management, Ubuntu 25.04 system Python 3.12, virtual environments
- **Team Configuration**: Template system, secret management, environment sync

### Contract Generation Strategy
- **Configuration Management API**: Setup, validation, rollback endpoints
- **AI Integration Interface**: Provider selection, context submission, response handling
- **Performance Monitoring API**: Metrics collection, alerting, optimization triggers
- **Team Collaboration Interface**: Template distribution, sync management, documentation

### Testing Integration
- Foundation preservation tests ensuring existing functionality
- Performance benchmark tests for constitutional compliance
- AI integration tests with privacy protection validation
- Team collaboration tests for configuration management

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Phase-based approach aligning with constitutional implementation phases
- AI Integration Foundation → Advanced Theming → Performance Optimization → Team Collaboration
- Each phase builds on previous while maintaining constitutional compliance
- Parallel execution opportunities for independent components

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation preservation validation before any advanced features
- AI integration with local fallbacks before performance-dependent features
- Theme system after AI integration stable
- Performance optimization after theme system validated
- Team features after individual productivity proven

**Estimated Output**: 60+ numbered, phased tasks in tasks.md following constitutional implementation phases

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (performance testing, constitutional compliance, foundation preservation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - all advanced features align with constitutional principles*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)

- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
