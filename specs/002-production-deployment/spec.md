# Feature Specification: Production Deployment & Maintenance Excellence

**Feature Branch**: `002-production-deployment`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Prerequisite**: Feature 001 (Modern Web Development Stack) - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Input**: Building upon the complete modern web development stack (Feature 001), create a production-ready deployment and maintenance system that addresses TypeScript errors, automates GitHub Pages deployment, implements monitoring/alerting, and provides ongoing maintenance automation while maintaining constitutional compliance.

## Execution Flow (main)
```

3. For each production-critical aspect:
   ‚è≥ PENDING: Error resolution, deployment pipeline, monitoring setup
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚è≥ PENDING: Production deployment scenarios and edge cases
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚è≥ PENDING: Production-ready deployment and maintenance requirements
6. Identify Key Entities for production operations
   ‚è≥ PENDING: Deployment artifacts, monitoring data, maintenance schedules
7. Run Review Checklist

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team with a complete modern web stack (Feature 001), I need a production-ready deployment and maintenance system that automatically resolves TypeScript build issues, deploys to GitHub Pages seamlessly, monitors site health and performance, and provides automated maintenance workflows, so that I can maintain a reliable, high-performance production website with minimal manual intervention while preserving constitutional compliance.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Feature 001 is complete with TypeScript errors, **When** I execute the production deployment workflow, **Then** all TypeScript issues are automatically resolved and the site builds successfully for GitHub Pages deployment

2. **Given** a successful build, **When** I trigger deployment, **Then** the site deploys to GitHub Pages with automated DNS configuration, HTTPS enforcement, and constitutional compliance validation

3. **Given** a production site is live, **When** monitoring is active, **Then** I receive automated alerts for performance degradation, accessibility issues, security vulnerabilities, and constitutional compliance violations

4. **Given** the site is in production, **When** dependencies need updates, **Then** automated maintenance workflows test updates locally, validate constitutional compliance, and deploy safely with rollback capability

5. **Given** production issues occur, **When** the monitoring system detects problems, **Then** automated recovery procedures execute with comprehensive logging and stakeholder notifications

### Edge Cases
- What happens when TypeScript strict mode blocking deployment? (Automated resolution with gradual strict mode migration)
- How does the system handle GitHub Pages deployment failures? (Retry mechanisms with fallback strategies)
- What if performance monitoring detects constitutional violations? (Automatic alerts with suggested fixes)
- How does automated maintenance handle breaking dependency updates? (Safe update testing with automatic rollback)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Production Deployment Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically resolve TypeScript strict mode errors to enable successful Astro builds
- **FR-002**: System MUST deploy to GitHub Pages via automated CI/CD pipeline with zero manual intervention
- **FR-003**: System MUST configure custom domain, HTTPS enforcement, and CDN optimization for production performance
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate constitutional compliance during every deployment (performance, accessibility, security)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide atomic deployments with instant rollback capability in case of failures

#### Monitoring & Alerting Requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST monitor site availability with 99.9% uptime SLA and automated incident response
- **FR-007**: System MUST track Core Web Vitals continuously and alert on constitutional performance violations
- **FR-008**: System MUST monitor accessibility compliance with automated WCAG 2.1 AA validation and reporting
- **FR-009**: System MUST detect security vulnerabilities in dependencies with automated patching workflows
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide real-time error tracking with intelligent error aggregation and root cause analysis

#### Maintenance & Automation Requirements
- **FR-011**: System MUST automate dependency updates with local validation, constitutional compliance testing, and safe deployment
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide scheduled maintenance windows with automated backup creation and restoration
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement content freshness monitoring with automated content validation and update notifications
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain deployment history with detailed change logs and performance impact analysis
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide disaster recovery procedures with automated backup restoration and data integrity validation

#### Integration & Compatibility Requirements
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with Feature 001 modern web development stack
- **FR-017**: System MUST integrate with existing local CI/CD infrastructure without breaking constitutional compliance
- **FR-018**: System MUST support multiple deployment environments (staging, production) with environment-specific configurations
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide comprehensive API endpoints for external monitoring and management tools
- **FR-020**: System MUST maintain detailed audit logs for all production operations with retention and compliance requirements

### Key Entities *(production-focused)*
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Contains automated build resolution, GitHub Pages deployment, DNS configuration, and rollback mechanisms
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Includes uptime monitoring, performance tracking, accessibility validation, security scanning, and alert management
- **Maintenance Automation**: Encompasses dependency management, content validation, backup procedures, and recovery workflows

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current Gaps from Feature 001
1. **TypeScript Build Errors**: Preventing successful Astro builds and GitHub Pages deployment
2. **Manual Deployment Process**: Requires automation for reliable production deployments
3. **No Production Monitoring**: Missing uptime, performance, and security monitoring
4. **Manual Maintenance**: No automated dependency updates or maintenance workflows
5. **Limited Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error recovery and rollback procedures

### Feature 002 Success Metrics
- **Deployment Success Rate**: 99.5% automated deployment success
- **Build Resolution**: 100% TypeScript error auto-resolution
- **Uptime Achievement**: 99.9% production availability
- **Performance Maintenance**: Constitutional targets maintained continuously
- **Maintenance Automation**: 95% of maintenance tasks automated

### Constitutional Compliance Integration
- **Zero GitHub Actions**: All production workflows execute locally first
- **Performance First**: Production monitoring enforces constitutional performance targets
- **User Preservation**: Production deployments preserve all user customizations
- **Branch Preservation**: Production branches follow constitutional naming and preservation
- **Local Validation**: All production changes validated locally before deployment
