## üéØ Constitutional Compliance Integration

### Zero GitHub Actions Principle
- **Local CI/CD First**: All production workflows execute locally before GitHub operations
- **Cost Monitoring**: Continuous GitHub Actions usage tracking with alerts
- **Alternative Automation**: GitHub CLI-based automation without Actions consumption

### Performance First Principle
- **Constitutional Targets**: Production monitoring enforces <100KB JS, <2.5s LCP, Lighthouse 95+
- **Performance Budgets**: Automated alerts when production metrics violate constitutional limits
- **Optimization Automation**: Continuous performance optimization with trend analysis

### User Preservation Principle
- **Configuration Backups**: Automated backup before all production changes
- **Rollback Procedures**: Instant rollback to preserve user experience
- **Customization Protection**: Production changes preserve all user customizations

### Branch Preservation Principle
- **Production Branches**: Follow constitutional YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS naming convention
- **History Preservation**: All production deployments maintain complete git history
- **No Auto-Deletion**: Production branches preserved for audit and recovery

### Local Validation Principle
- **Pre-Production Testing**: All changes validated locally before production deployment
- **Constitutional Checks**: Automated constitutional compliance validation in deployment pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Production deployment blocked if local validation fails
