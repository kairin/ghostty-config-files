# Split management
keybind = cmd+s>z=toggle_split_zoom     # Focus single pane (article mentions this)
keybind = cmd+s>e=equalize_splits       # Balance all splits
keybind = cmd+s>shift+x=close_split     # Close current split

# Resize splits
keybind = cmd+s>shift+h=resize_split:left,10
keybind = cmd+s>shift+j=resize_split:down,10
keybind = cmd+s>shift+k=resize_split:up,10
keybind = cmd+s>shift+l=resize_split:right,10

# === SEARCH & NAVIGATION ===
# Article emphasizes search functionality
keybind = cmd+s>f=search
keybind = cmd+s>shift+f=search:backward
keybind = cmd+s>/=search
keybind = cmd+s>?=search:backward

# Scrollback navigation
keybind = cmd+s>u=scroll_page_up
keybind = cmd+s>d=scroll_page_down
keybind = cmd+s>g=scroll_to_top
keybind = cmd+s>shift+g=scroll_to_bottom

# === COPY/PASTE & SELECTION ===
# Enhanced clipboard operations
keybind = cmd+s>y=copy_to_clipboard
keybind = cmd+s>p=paste_from_clipboard

keybind = cmd+s>shift+p=paste_from_primary

# Selection modes
keybind = cmd+s>v=toggle_selection_mode
keybind = cmd+s>shift+v=selection_mode:line

# === PRODUCTIVITY SHORTCUTS ===
# Based on article's developer workflow suggestions

# Clear screen and scrollback
keybind = cmd+s>ctrl+l=clear_screen_and_scrollback

# Font size adjustment for different tasks
keybind = cmd+s>equal=increase_font_size:1
