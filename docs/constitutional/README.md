# Constitutional Compliance Framework

## Core Constitutional Principles

### 1. Zero GitHub Actions Consumption
All CI/CD operations execute locally to maintain zero GitHub Actions minute consumption.

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check GitHub Actions usage
gh api user/settings/billing/actions | jq '.total_paid_minutes_used'

# Should return: 0
```

### 2. Performance First
Maintain constitutional performance targets across all operations.

**Targets**:
- Lighthouse Performance: 95+
- Build Time: <30 seconds
- Bundle Size: <100KB (JS) + <20KB (CSS)
- Core Web Vitals: All targets met

### 3. User Preservation
Never overwrite user customizations during updates.

**Implementation**:
- Intelligent diff detection
- Backup creation before changes
- Selective feature application
- Customization restoration

### 4. Branch Preservation
Constitutional naming and no branch deletion without explicit permission.

**Format**: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-type-description`

### 5. Local Validation
Test everything locally before any deployment.

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Complete local validation
./local-infra/runners/gh-workflow-local.sh all

# Individual validation steps
./local-infra/runners/test-runner-local.sh
./local-infra/runners/benchmark-runner.sh
./local-infra/runners/performance-monitor.sh
```

## Compliance Validation

### Automated Compliance Checks
```bash
# Run constitutional validation
python scripts/constitutional_automation.py --validate

# Check all compliance requirements
./local-infra/runners/test-runner-local.sh --constitutional
```

### Manual Compliance Verification
1. **Zero GitHub Actions**: Verify billing shows 0 paid minutes
2. **Performance Targets**: All benchmarks pass constitutional thresholds
3. **User Preservation**: No user settings overwritten during updates
4. **Branch Preservation**: All branches follow naming convention
5. **Local Validation**: All workflows execute locally successfully

## Constitutional Violations

### Automatic Detection
The system automatically detects and prevents:
- GitHub Actions minute consumption
- Performance regression below targets
- User customization overwrites
- Branch deletion without permission
- Deployment without local validation

### Violation Response
When violations are detected:
1. **Immediate Halt**: Stop offending operation
2. **Rollback**: Restore previous state
3. **Alert**: Log constitutional violation
4. **Report**: Generate compliance report
5. **Remediation**: Provide correction steps
