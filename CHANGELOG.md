# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Tab-title engine (`configs/fish/functions/`): `fish_title` shows `🌐 <label> 📁 <path> <icon> <cmd>` — host/label shown only over SSH (`<label>` from machine-local `~/.host-label`, e.g. "DGX", seeded from hostname by install.sh). The per-command emoji is derived **systematically from the command's apt `Section`** (`__app_icon` → `dpkg -S` → `${Section}` → `__app_section_icon`), cached per session with a small override list for non-apt tools; default `⚡`. Single-codepoint emoji only so GTK/AppKit tab labels render them. install.sh symlinks the functions; uninstall.sh removes them.
- `.gitignore` now also excludes `.envrc` (machine-local direnv bootstrap), `.host-label`, and `.codacy/` so no machine-local config or token can be committed.
- Fish shell environment captured in the repo for reproducible multi-machine setup: `configs/fish/config.fish` (PATH, fnm, bun, uv/gum/glow completions, fzf, zoxide `z`, starship, and a parser for the machine-local bash-syntax `~/.mcp-secrets`) and `configs/starship/starship.toml` (Catppuccin Mocha prompt, replacing the old powerlevel10k zsh setup).
- `install.sh` now sets up the fish shell env: installs fish + zoxide (`sudo apt`) and starship (userspace `~/.local/bin`), symlinks `config.fish`/`starship.toml` into `~/.config`, and offers `chsh` to fish. Idempotent and tolerant of no-sudo / non-interactive runs. `--no-shell` skips it; `uninstall.sh` removes the new symlinks (apt/starship/chsh left in place).

### Changed
- `dev.fish` now manages the `og-tools` session (windows `claude`, `codex`, `agy`, rooted in `~/Apps/OG-tools`) and is a toggle: outside tmux it attaches (creating the session if needed), inside tmux it detaches so panes keep running in the background. Added `dev reset` to force a fresh rebuild. Repo file, live `~/.config/fish/functions/dev.fish` symlink, and docs reconciled — the live file had drifted to a detached standalone copy.

### Fixed
- `clipboard-trim-trailing-spaces` set to `false` — was silently dropping the last character when copied text ended with a space (nushell output, etc.)

## [2026-05-31]

### Fixed
- tmux: enable `set-clipboard on` for system clipboard pass-through via OSC 52 (#242)

### Added
- tmux dev layout via `dev.fish` — launches claude (left) + nushell (right) split (#240)

### Changed
- `.envrc.local` added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing local PAT overrides (#241)
- Docs aligned across CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / GEMINI.md after Opus review (#243)

## [2026-05-28]

### Changed
- Clean rebuild: single consolidated Ghostty config (no modular includes), font-picker script, install/uninstall scripts (#239)
