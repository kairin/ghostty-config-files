- **Environment Sync**: Consistent setups across development, staging, production environments
- **Secret Management**: Encrypted dotfile management with chezmoi integration
- **Documentation Integration**: Auto-generated setup guides and troubleshooting
- **Zero Lock-in**: All team features SHALL work with standard tools and processes

### V. Constitutional Preservation Principle (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **Branch Preservation**: Constitutional naming maintained (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-feat-description)
- **User Customization**: Advanced features SHALL preserve existing user configurations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Constitutional targets continuously validated
- **Rollback Capability**: Instant rollback to foundation state if advanced features fail
