## 🎯 How Context7 Usage Is Improved

### Before
```
No Context7 integration mentioned
```
❌ No guidance on querying latest Git/GitHub standards

### After
```markdown
## 📚 Context7 Integration (Best Practices Query)

**CRITICAL: Query Context7 for Latest Git/GitHub Standards**

Before executing complex operations, query Context7 MCP for latest best practices:

**Query Context7 for Git Best Practices**:
1. Git Workflow: Query for latest branching strategies
   - mcp__context7__resolve-library-id → Search "Git workflow best practices"
   - Verify current branching models (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based)

2. GitHub Actions: Query for CI/CD best practices
   - Search for "GitHub Actions zero-cost strategies"
   - Verify self-hosted runner security standards

3. Commit Conventions: Query for Conventional Commits standard
   - Verify format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
   - Check latest type and scope guidelines

4. Branch Protection: Query for repository security standards
5. Documentation Standards: Query for README and docs best practices

**Comparative Analysis**:
Current Implementation vs Context7 Standards:
1. Branch Naming: [YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-type-description] vs [Context7 Latest] → [Gap Analysis]
2. Commit Format: [Constitutional format] vs [Conventional Commits v1.0.0] → [Validation]
3. Merge Strategy: [--no-ff] vs [Context7 Recommended] → [Compliance Check]
```
✅ Specific, actionable instructions with exact MCP tool usage

## 🎯 Usage Recommendation

The enhanced agent should be invoked in these scenarios:

### 1. Work Completion
```bash
user: "Okay, that's done. The new shell integration is working now."
→ Invoke agent to commit, push, sync, merge to main (preserve feature branch)
```

### 2. Critical Documentation Modified
```bash
user: "I've updated the AGENTS.md file with new Context7 requirements"
→ Invoke agent to verify symlinks, commit, sync (CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md integrity)
```

### 3. Context Switching
```bash
user: "Now let's work on the Tailwind v4 migration"
→ Invoke agent to create checkpoint, sync current work, prepare clean state
```

### 4. Explicit Sync Request
```bash
user: "Can you save all this to GitHub?"
→ Invoke agent to validate commits, push to remote, verify bidirectional sync
```

### 5. Proactive Monitoring
```bash
# Agent detects >50 lines uncommitted OR >30 minutes without sync
→ Auto-invoke to create checkpoint and prevent data loss
```

---

## ✅ Verification

To verify the enhanced agent works correctly:

1. **Test Constitutional Compliance**:
   - Invoke agent with non-compliant branch name
   - Verify it auto-renames with YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-type-description
   - Verify old branch archived (not deleted) with archive-YYYYMMDD- prefix

2. **Test Symlink Integrity**:
   - Create CLAUDE.md as regular file (not symlink)
   - Invoke agent
   - Verify backup created, content merged to AGENTS.md, symlink restored

3. **Test Security Verification**:
   - Stage .env file
   - Invoke agent
   - Verify agent halts with exact recovery commands

4. **Test docs/.nojekyll Protection**:
   - Delete docs/.nojekyll
   - Invoke agent
   - Verify agent halts with CRITICAL warning and restoration commands

5. **Test Context7 Integration**:
   - Invoke agent with Context7 MCP available
   - Verify it queries Git/GitHub best practices
   - Check report includes "Context7 Insights" section

6. **Test 5-Phase Workflow**:
   - Invoke agent on feature branch with uncommitted changes
   - Verify all phases execute: Pre-Flight → Local Assessment → Remote Sync → Push → Merge
   - Verify structured report includes all sections

7. **Test Merge to Main**:
   - Invoke agent after feature work complete
   - Verify --no-ff merge to main
   - Verify feature branch preserved (not deleted)
   - Verify return to feature branch

## 📚 Key Constitutional Compliance Features

### Branch Preservation (SACRED)
**Before**: Mentioned but not enforced
**After**:
- NEVER DELETE branches (use archive-YYYYMMDD- prefix)
- Non-fast-forward merges (--no-ff) to preserve history
- Auto-archive non-compliant branches
- Return to feature branch after merge (never stays on main)

### Branch Naming (MANDATORY)
**Before**: Format mentioned
**After**:
- Regex validation: `^[0-9]{8}-[0-9]{6}-(feat|fix|docs|refactor|test|chore)-.+$`
- Auto-fix with archive (not delete)
- Examples: 20251112-143000-feat-context7-integration
- NEVER work directly on main

### Documentation Integrity (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
**Before**: Basic check
**After**:
- AGENTS.md is authoritative (803 lines as of 2025-11-12)
- CLAUDE.md MUST be symlink (not regular file)
- GEMINI.md MUST be symlink (not regular file)
- Auto-fix: backup → merge → replace → stage → commit

### Security First (SACRED)
**Before**: Basic warnings
**After**:
- 5-step pre-commit verification (MANDATORY)
- HALT on .env, .eml, *credentials*, *secret*, *key*, *token*
- Verify .gitignore coverage
- Large file scanning (warn >10MB, halt >100MB)
- Symlink validation before commit

### Critical Files Protection
**Before**: Not mentioned
**After**:
- **docs/.nojekyll**: CRITICAL for GitHub Pages (Astro _astro/ assets)
- Auto-verify existence before commit
- HALT with restoration commands if missing
- Explanation: Without it, Jekyll breaks Astro asset loading

## 🚦 Automatic Git Workflow Compliance

The enhanced agent automatically executes the full git workflow:

1. **Commit** → Constitutional format with types, scopes, Claude attribution
2. **Push** → With upstream tracking, verification of remote receipt
3. **Sync** → Bidirectional (fetch, pull, push) with divergence handling
4. **Deploy** → Automatic when .github/workflows/ configured
5. **Merge** → To main with --no-ff (preserves branch history)
6. **Preserve** → Feature branch NEVER deleted (constitutional requirement)

All while following AGENTS.md requirements for:
- ✅ Branch naming: YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-type-description
- ✅ Branch preservation: Archive, never delete
- ✅ Symlink integrity: CLAUDE.md → AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md → AGENTS.md
- ✅ Security: No .env, credentials, large files
- ✅ Critical files: docs/.nojekyll present
- ✅ Context7 validation: Latest Git/GitHub best practices
