# Data Model: Modern Web Development Stack

**Feature**: Modern Web Development Stack
**Created**: 2025-01-20
**Status**: Design Phase

## Entity Overview
The modern web development stack consists of five primary entities that manage configuration, workflow, infrastructure, metrics, and deployment processes.

## Core Entities

### 1. Project Configuration
**Purpose**: Central configuration management for all stack components
**Lifecycle**: Created during project initialization, updated throughout development

**Attributes**:
- `python_config`: Python environment settings (uv version, Python version, virtual environment path)
- `astro_config`: Astro framework configuration (build settings, integrations, output directory)
- `tailwind_config`: Tailwind CSS design system configuration (theme, plugins, purge settings)
- `shadcn_config`: Component library configuration (base components, theme variables, icon system)
- `typescript_config`: TypeScript strict mode settings and compiler options

**Validation Rules**:
- uv version must be >= 0.4.0
- Python version must be >= 3.12
- Astro version must be >= 4.0
- Tailwind version must be >= 3.4
- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled

**Relationships**:
- Configures → Local CI/CD Infrastructure
- Validates → Development Workflow
- Generates → Performance Metrics

### 2. Local CI/CD Infrastructure
**Purpose**: Local workflow execution and validation system
**Lifecycle**: Established during initial setup, maintained throughout project lifecycle

**Attributes**:
- `runners`: Collection of local execution scripts (astro-build-local.sh, gh-workflow-local.sh, performance-monitor.sh)
- `logs`: Execution history and error tracking (build logs, workflow logs, performance metrics)
- `config`: Workflow definitions and test suite configurations
- `hooks`: Git hook integrations (pre-commit, pre-push, post-merge)
- `status`: Current infrastructure health and last execution results

**Validation Rules**:
- All runner scripts must be executable and return proper exit codes
- Log retention must maintain last 30 days of execution history
- Git hooks must enforce local validation before any GitHub operations
- Zero GitHub Actions consumption must be maintained

**State Transitions**:
- Inactive → Active (via setup scripts)
- Active → Validating (during workflow execution)
- Validating → Success/Failed (based on validation results)
- Failed → Active (after error resolution)

**Relationships**:
- Executes → Development Workflow
- Generates → Performance Metrics
- Validates → Deployment Pipeline

### 3. Development Workflow
**Purpose**: Git-based development process with local validation
**Lifecycle**: Active throughout development, enforced via git hooks

**Attributes**:
- `branch_strategy`: Timestamped branch naming (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-type-description)
- `commit_workflow`: Local validation sequence before commit
- `validation_gates`: Required checks (build, performance, security, accessibility)
- `merge_strategy`: No-fast-forward merges with branch preservation
- `rollback_procedures`: Error recovery and state restoration

**Validation Rules**:
- All commits must pass local CI/CD validation
- Branch names must follow timestamped convention
- No branches may be deleted without explicit permission
- All validation gates must pass before GitHub operations

**State Transitions**:
- Development → Local Validation → Commit → Push → Merge → Preserve

**Relationships**:
- Triggers → Local CI/CD Infrastructure
- Produces → Performance Metrics
- Enables → Deployment Pipeline

### 4. Performance Metrics
**Purpose**: Continuous performance tracking and validation
**Lifecycle**: Generated during each build and deployment cycle

**Attributes**:
- `lighthouse_scores`: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO (target: 95+ each)
- `core_web_vitals`: FCP, LCP, CLS measurements (targets: <1.5s, <2.5s, <0.1)
- `bundle_metrics`: JavaScript and CSS bundle sizes (target: <100KB initial JS)
- `build_performance`: Local build times and hot reload performance
- `accessibility_audit`: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification
- `security_scan`: Dependency vulnerability assessment

**Validation Rules**:
- Lighthouse scores must be >= 95 for all metrics
- Core Web Vitals must meet specified thresholds
- Bundle sizes must not exceed constitutional limits
- Security vulnerabilities must be addressed before deployment

**Historical Tracking**:
- Maintains 90-day performance history
- Trend analysis for regression detection
- Automated alerts for threshold violations

**Relationships**:
- Generated by → Local CI/CD Infrastructure
- Validates → Deployment Pipeline
- Influences → Project Configuration updates

### 5. Deployment Pipeline
**Purpose**: Zero-cost GitHub Pages deployment with optimization
**Lifecycle**: Triggered after successful local validation

**Attributes**:
- `github_pages_config`: Repository settings, custom domain, HTTPS enforcement
- `asset_optimization`: Image compression, CSS/JS minification, caching strategies
- `deployment_status`: Current deployment state and health monitoring
- `cost_monitoring`: GitHub Actions usage tracking (target: zero consumption)
- `rollback_capability`: Previous version preservation and quick restoration

**Validation Rules**:
- Deployment only after successful local CI/CD validation
- Asset optimization must maintain performance targets
- HTTPS must be enforced for all custom domains
- Zero GitHub Actions consumption for routine operations

**State Transitions**:
- Ready → Deploying → Success/Failed → Monitoring → Ready

**Relationships**:
- Triggered by → Development Workflow
- Validated by → Local CI/CD Infrastructure
- Reports to → Performance Metrics

## Entity Relationships

### Primary Flows
1. **Configuration → Infrastructure → Workflow → Metrics → Deployment**
2. **Workflow triggers Infrastructure validation**
3. **Infrastructure generates Metrics**
4. **Metrics validate Deployment readiness**
5. **Deployment reports back to Metrics**

### Validation Dependencies
- Project Configuration validates all other entities
- Local CI/CD Infrastructure must be healthy for workflow execution
- Performance Metrics must meet thresholds for deployment
- Development Workflow must complete successfully for deployment trigger

## Data Persistence

### Configuration Files
- `pyproject.toml`: Python environment and dependency configuration
- `astro.config.mjs`: Astro framework build configuration
- `tailwind.config.mjs`: Tailwind CSS design system configuration
- `components.json`: shadcn/ui component library configuration
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration

### Runtime Data
- `.runners-local/logs/workflows/`: Execution logs and performance metrics (JSON format)
- `.runners-local/config/`: Workflow definitions and test configurations
- `.venv/`: Python virtual environment (managed by uv)
- `dist/`: Build artifacts for deployment

### Version Control
- All configuration files tracked in git
- Runtime data excluded via .gitignore
- Build artifacts excluded from repository
- Log files maintained locally only

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data
- No API keys or secrets in configuration files
- Environment variables for runtime secrets
- Local CI/CD logs may contain sensitive build information

### Access Control
- GitHub repository permissions control deployment access
- Local CI/CD infrastructure requires local machine access
- Branch protection rules enforce review requirements

### Audit Trail
- Complete workflow execution logging
- Performance metrics historical tracking
- Git commit history with constitutional compliance

## Conclusion
The data model supports a complete modern web development stack with constitutional compliance, local CI/CD validation, and zero-cost deployment. All entities work together to ensure performance, security, and developer experience requirements are met.
