name: Deploy Astro Site to GitHub Pages (DISABLED - Self-Hosted Runner Not Configured)

# ISSUE: This workflow requires a self-hosted runner but none is configured
# STATUS: Disabled to prevent stuck workflows
# SOLUTION: Use astro-build-deploy.yml (GitHub-hosted) or configure self-hosted runner
# See: .runners-local/runners/setup-self-hosted-runner.sh
